Shell Scripting Projects for Automation & DevOps Practice

🚧 **Status:** Learning & Hands-on Practice (Active)

---

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **shell scripting projects** created to strengthen my understanding of **Linux automation, scripting logic, and real-world DevOps use cases**.

The focus of this repo is:
- Writing practical shell scripts
- Automating repetitive operational tasks
- Understanding how shell scripts fit into CI/CD and cloud workflows

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn Bash scripting fundamentals
- Apply scripting to real DevOps scenarios
- Build confidence in automation using Linux tools
- Prepare scripts that can later be integrated into CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Shell / Bash  
- Linux (Ubuntu / RHEL)  
- Git & GitHub  
- Cron, system commands, environment variables  

---

## 📂 Project Structure
Each project/script focuses on a specific problem such as:
- System monitoring
- File & log management
- User and process automation
- Error handling and validations

Each script includes:
- Problem statement
- Script logic
- Execution steps

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Writing clean and readable shell scripts
- Using conditions, loops, and functions
- Handling arguments and exit codes
- Automating tasks commonly done manually in production environments
- Understanding where shell scripting fits in **CI/CD pipelines**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
